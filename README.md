## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BOOTSTRAP V4
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
### What I learned

I was able to improve my bootstrap skills and learn some CSS concepts like 
```css
 .bdy{
  position: fixed !important;
  top: 0; 
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  background: hsl(216, 12%, 8%);
  max-width: 100%;
}
```
### Continued development
I still plan to write a better function to get and set the rated value for the buttons.
